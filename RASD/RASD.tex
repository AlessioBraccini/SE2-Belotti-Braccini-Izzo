\section{Introduction}
\emph{Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing}, also known as \emph{DREAM}, is a project presented by UNDP India and Healthsites initiative, promoted by Telangana's government.
The aim of the project is to enhance the farm system and the entire food supply chain with an IT supporting application. 
This arises from modern challenges like climate change and the foreseen population growth that have underlined the critical issues of the modern system making necessary a complete overhaul.


\subsection{Purpose} %goals of the project
\emph{DREAM} aims to support work categories involved into the farming industry by providing them relevant and up-to-date data about the farm activity's performance. 
The main stakeholders are: Telangana's policy makers, farmers and agronomists.
The goal is to develop a data-driven application with the help of IT partners.
Telangana's state already collect important data concerning wheather forecast, these data are publicly available with a live rainfall map on the official government website.
Other data can be collected through humidity sensors deployed all over the territory and through the water irrigation system.

Agriculture has a main role in India's economy, more than half of the population depends on it and about a fifth is below the poverty line.
Furthermore, as a significant increment in population is expected by 2050 (\emph{UN}'s esteem), food demand is going to significantly increase.
Telangana needs an efficient application to increase the general productivity of the farm system.

The user base is expected to include a large part of Telangana's population, bringing together people with different knowledge backgrounds, such as people directly working in the agricolture field up to political figures.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\newcounter{goalCtr}
\underline{Shared goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Make crops weather-resiliant across the State} \\ The aim of every stakeholder of the project is to grow more resiliant crops to raise the productivity. This means more product to sell for the farmers as well as, for the policy makers and agronomists, more supply on the market to satify the increasing demand of the population.
    \item  \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Reach out to farmers in need of help} \\ Farmers that struggle with their cultivation wish to be helped and turn around their business in a positive way, since their income depend on that. At the same time, given the forseen food supply demand, policy makers and agronomists strive for reaching the maximum potential of every suppliers.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{Telangana's policy makers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Identification of well-performing farmers}\\
    Main goal of the policy makers is to identify farmers that are resilient to meteorological adverse events.
    This can be done comparing the productivity ratio defined as the produced amount per product in adverse condition over the amount in standard conditions.
    This farmers will receive special incentives and will be asked to help other farmers 
    with useful practices.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Identification of bad-performing farmers}\\
    Identify farmers that are performing badly in order to seek the help for them to get back on track. In fact, they are the ones that need to be helped by the well-performing farmers.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize the results of steering initiatives}\\
    Visualize and evaluate the results produced by the steering initiatives from agronomists and good farmers in order to assess which are resulting useful and actually improving the food production system, so that those practices can be applied on a larger scale.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{Farmers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize relevant data for the business}\\
    Visualize important data like weather forecast and personalized suggestion about specific crops or fertilizers.
    All data are based on location and type of production.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Keep track of the production}\\
    Insert data about their production to identify trends of their own doings, especially bad ones undermining their revenue. Register every type of problem they're experiencing for further inspection with the help of experts in the field.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Request for help/suggestion}\\
    Farmers can request help with a text message that will be sent directly to the agronomists responsible of the area to better their practice both in critical conditions and for improvement purposes. Thanks to this, the farmers are not required to know directly the contact of one of the agronomists, because the system will provide the contacts of the area they need automatically.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Create and participate in discussions concerning the agricolture field}\\
    Create forums to discuss with the other farmers. This feature shall allow a farmer-user to choose the name of a new topic they wish to introduce in the forum and to join all already open discussions. The purpose of this is to ease the cultivation-related knowledge spreading from which every farmer would benefit.
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Agronomists}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Receive requests for help/suggestion all in one place}\\
    Here the agronomist can manage all the incoming request for help or suggestion and will have an higher chance of intervening promptly in critical situations before it's too late. In fact, having just one place in which all the requests that need attention are cumulated makes easier for them to not miss them, rather than losing them because of the different means they could come from and in a cluttered way.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize area stats}\\
    Keep track of the area general performance through a list of best-performing farmers and visualize data about whether forecast.
    %The list of best-performing farmers is based on the productivity over a selected period of time.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Easy daily planning procedure}\\
    The daily plan consists in a list of farms to be visited during the day.
    Since, by regulations, every farm must be visited at least twice a year, with particular attention to the under-performing ones that should be visited more often, agronomists wish to be suggested of which are the farms that are due to be visited or the ones that have not been visited yet during the year.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Class diagram}
A UML class diagram describes the main entities in the system.
Three types of actors can access the system: farmers, policy makers and agronomists.
During the sign-up, they all create a user account with basic information such as username, password and e-mail.
At this point, users are requested to choose what type of account to create. It is crucial that phisycal users register themselves accordingly to their job to ensure that the system works properly. Furthermore, this choice affects the next steps in the registration phase; for example, to complete the registration, farmers need to specify the address of their farm and what type of crop they grow, whereas agronomists must declare their area of responsibility.

The system provides several functionalities tailored for the type of user, one of these is the forum for the farmers. When the farmers select the forum section, they are presented with the topics that are already active. For each topic, the discussion that has evolved through time can be seen: it's composed by the original post and its replies from other users. From here, the user can join an already ongoing discussion or create a new one generating a new topic and post the first message for it.

Another functionality is the \textit{daily plan} feature for the agronomists.
A daily plan is a list of farms that an agronomist has decided to visit on a particular day of the year, it has a date and a status flag that indicates whether the plan has already been confirmed or not. The schedule can be planned from the day before the actual visit and be confirmed until 23:59 of the visiting day. If the agronomist fills the plan and doesn't confirm it before the time limit expires, then the system will automatically assumes that the schedule has been followed and will archive it at the end of the day. For the planner, agronomists have access to the list of farmers currently in their area of responsibility.

Finally, there are various types of data that can be visualized and analyzed by the users
depending on the type of their account.
There are four types of data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Soil humidity sensors data}\\
    Acquired by the sensors distributed all over the territory, they report values that represent the soil moisture level of the land they cover.
    \item \textbf{Weather forecast data}\\
    Meteorological short-term and long-term forecast acquired by Telangana's government and displayed on their official website. They are comprehensive of temperature, rainfall probability and quantity, direction and strength of the wind and air humidity.
    \item \textbf{Water irrigation data}\\
    Acquired by the water irrigation system installed in the farms, the only significant value is the amount of water used by the system during the day.
    \item \textbf{Production data}\\
    Provided by the farmers, this type of data is displayed as a table that maps the type of cultivated product to the sown amount and the respective harvested quantity.

\subsection{User characteristics}
The application has been thought for the three different user categories that follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy makers} are government's employees that are in charge of analysing the general agricolture trends among all the districts in Telangana, then promote based state-wide policies to better the whole food system. Their main goal is not only to secure the current provision, but also to identify now the best practices that will lead to a flourishing food production in the future. By doing so, the plan is to grow more resiliant and profitable crops and prepare the lands to face future menaces, for instance the climate that is getting more hostile or the foreseen increment of the food demand. As a consequence, they want to be notified about the best performing farmers in order to contact them and get more insight from them about their procedures, with the aim to acquire best practises to be shared and applied on a larger scale. At the same time, they need to know who, on the other hand, is performing particularly badly, so that they can be given the help they need to better their results, since obtaining the foresaid goal requires the structure to run smoothly in all its parts. 
    Policy makers also need a feedback system that let them be aware of the true impact \textit{a posteriori} of the initiatives carried out by the agronomists in collaboration with the knowledge and practice of the best farmers.
    \item \textbf{Farmers} are interested in functionalities that will help with their day-to-day life at work, so they would like to receive in one place all the information about the weather to plan before hand the work day and useful data, like suggestions and news about the specific crop they cultivate, if some crop's illness is spreading in their area and how to treat it, which fertilizers boost the plant's production, etc. Moreover, they should insert data about their own production and ask for help to a regional agronomist through the app if it's needed. Being part of a larger community of people that share the same purpose (such as being more productive) brings more knowledge in general, so it's easier for the farmers to get in touch with their collegues that grow the same crops and might have faced the same challenges they do through the in-app forum. The feature allows them to enlarge their pool of acquaintances and brings them together online, even though they might be kilometers away from each other.
    \item \textbf{Agronomists} are the experts in the agricolture field, so the main function needed for them is the possibility of helping out the farmers that reach out to them. Each agronomist is in charge of a specific geographical area in Telangana, in order to be efficiently present on the territory in a fair and useful way according to the actual helping demand. In fact, they visit each farm spread among their area at least twice a year. That said, agronomists would like some functionalities that help them planning out their trips on the field in an simple yet flexible way. Furthermore, they would like to be notified of the farms' performace, especially the ones scoring poor results in order to plan their visits more often for those, depending on the problem their facing. Nonetheless, in order to make a complete and axhaustive report about the area productivity for the central government, they are also interested into acknowledging the top performing farms. %wheather forecast? go deeper in explaining daily plan funct?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
\newcounter{assumptionCtr}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists actually stick to the scheduled daily plan
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists correct their schedule at the end of the day if deviations occur
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Each user registers according to their role and always feeds correct information to the app
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: The internet connection works properly
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: The sensors measuring humidity level of the soil work properly, with at most an error of 1\%

    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists periodically report their initiatives to the central government.
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Users own an IT device to connect to the application
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Devices external to the system (e.g. humidity sensors, water irrigation systems, weather stations) are active and working properly for 99.9\% of the year
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: A user register only once, choosing just one type of account accordingly to their real job
\end{itemize}

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The system should interface with users through devices which must be connected to the Internet.
Everyone that needs to use this service would connect to it through a web broswer from an existing domain, for example: dream.com.
It must be easy to use as it will have to be used from different kind of people, sometimes with a not great affinity with technologies.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The system "as it is" does not provide specific hardware equipment in order to access to web site. To use all functionalities it's required to have an IT devices connected to the internet, eventually a user can decide to use GPS to insert his own location and only proper devices with GPS equipment can do this. 

Soil data, obtained from sensors, are collect by someone else and will be added by the policy makers, also this not requires any special kind of hardware.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\label{software_interfaces}
In order to use the system it's required the use of a web broswer, on that will run the application.

System will also use some important interfaces in order to accomplish its functionalities.

First is an external API to access maps which will use the position acquired by the user settings to return an interactive map with a marker on that exact position.

Second API service used is the one of the DBMS system which will be adopted in order to query the internal database.

Another API will be use to access the external database containing data reguarding the sensor data and the other external data that the system need.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
Internet connection is mandatory in order to access to every formation that the system will display.
Users that want full functionalities have to have a GPS system on their device in order to guarantee a certain level of precision in the localization phase.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The majority of the user base will be represented by the farmers that cover the 58\% of the entire population of Telengana.
According to Unique Identification Aadhar India the Telangana population in 2021 is estimated to be 39.9 million.
This means that the system is expected to be widely adopted with the registration of millions of users just in the first year.
Also the average workload of the system is expected to be high, the goal is to guarantee the simultaneous connection of 200.000 individuals.
A mid-term goal could be to improve the scalability of the system in order to guarantee an efficient service to all users.
Finally the system should have a good response time, less than 3 seconds is reasonable.
\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
DREAM's user data must be treated respecting the law according to the PDPA.
All hardware devices distributed all over the territory (sensors) must comply the CE safety standards.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The software is designed to enhance the portability, in fact it is enough to have a device with a stable internet connection.
In order to use the application correctly it is required to have a device equipped with GPS.
%\subsubsection{Any other constraint}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
To ensure data consistency the system must have a fully backup infrastructure, this allows to recover from general failures in the main system.
The four components shown in the \textit{Figure(\ref{fig: availability})} operate in parallel, this guarantees high reliability and the correct functioning of the overall system in the case of a single component failure.
Finally all the components of the system must be characterized by the highest MTTF and by the lowest MTTR possible.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The system should be up almost 24/7 in order to allow users to use the application's services at any time.
The peak of use is expected during the working hours, it means that it is better to do all the maintainance activities during the night hours.

        \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Availability} & \textbf{Downtime}\\
        \hline
        Main System & 99.999\% (5-nines) & 5 minutes/year\\
        Government Website & 99.9\% (3-nines) & 8.76 hours/year\\
        Water Irrigation System & 99.9\% (3-nines) & 8.76 hours/year\\
        Humidity Sensors & 99\% (2-nines) & 3.65 days/year\\
        GPS & 99.999\% (5-nines) & 5 minutes/year\\
        \hline
        Entire System & 99.998\% & 10 minutes/year
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Security}
All the data stored by the system must be encrypted with a standard algorithm like the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
The communications goes on a secure channel powered by the SSL protocol.
In addition users can request a two-factor authentication (2FA) to improve the security of the personal account.
All data should be stored in compliance with PDPA's regulation.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The maintainability is guaranteed by high standard of code, the use of design patterns will enhance this point and guarantee high reusability.
The code must be extensively tested.
The system must be extendible in order to support future updates.
User's application will be regularly updated.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The system is designed to work on different operating systems like Windows, MacOS and Linux.
All main browsers are supported.
