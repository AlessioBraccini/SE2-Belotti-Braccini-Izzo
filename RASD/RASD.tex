\section{Introduction}
\emph{Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing}, also known as \emph{DREAM}, is a project presented by UNDP India and Healthsites initiative, promoted by Telangana's government.
The aim of the project is to enhance the farm system and the entire food supply chain with an IT supporting application. 
This arises from modern challenges like climate change and the foreseen population growth that have underlined the critical issues of the modern system making necessary a complete overhaul.


\subsection{Purpose} %goals of the project
\emph{DREAM} aims to support work categories involved into the farming industry by providing them relevant and up-to-date data about the farm activity's performance. 
The main stakeholders are: Telangana's policy makers, farmers and agronomists.
The goal is to develop a data-driven application with the help of IT partners.
Telangana's state already collect important data concerning wheather forecast, these data are publicly available with a live rainfall map on the official government website.
Other data can be collected through humidity sensors deployed all over the territory and through the water irrigation system.

Agriculture has a main role in India's economy, more than half of the population depends on it and about a fifth is below the poverty line.
Furthermore, as a significant increment in population is expected for 2050 (\emph{UN}'s esteem), food demand is going to significantly increase.
Telangana needs an efficient application to increase the general productivity of the farm system.

The user base is expected to be the entire population of Telangana, starting with those who works in the agricolture sector up to normal citizens.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\underline{Telangana's policy makers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Identification of well-performing farmers}\\
    Main goal of the policy makers is to identify farmers that are resilient to meteorological adverse events.
    This can be done comparing the productivity ratio defined as the produced amount per product in adverse condition over the amount in standard conditions.
    This farmers will receive special incentives and will be asked to help other farmers 
    with useful practices.
    \item \textbf{Identification of bad-performing farmers}\\
    Identify farmers that are performing bad using the productivity ratio, they are the ones that need to be helped 
    by the well-performing farmers.
    \item \textbf{Visualize the results of steering initiatives}\\
    Visualize and evaluate the results produced by the steering initiatives from agronomists and good farmers.
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Farmers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Visualize data}\\
    Visualize important data like weather forecast and personalized suggestion about specific crops or fertilizers.
    All data are based on location and type of production.
    \item \textbf{Insert data}\\
    Insert data about their production, report every type of problems.
    \item \textbf{Request for help/suggestion}\\
    Farmers can request help with a text message that will be sent directly to the agronomists responsible of the area.
    \item \textbf{Create discussion forums}\\
    Create forums to discuss with the other farmers.
    In this section the creator can choose the name of the forum and invite all the desirable partecipants.
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Agronomists}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Insert area}\\
    Insert the area of responsibility for the agronomist.
    \item \textbf{Receive request for help/suggestion}\\
    Here the agronomist can manage all the incoming request for help or suggestion.
    This can be done with a specific section where the agronomist can visualize the message and answer it.
    \item \textbf{Visualize area stats}\\
    Visualize data about whether forecast or a list of best-performing farmers.
    The list of best-performing farmers is based on the productivity over a selected period of time.
    \item \textbf{Visualize and update daily plan}\\
    The daily plan consists in a list of farms to be visited during the day.
    Every farm must be visited at least twice a year with particular attention to the under-performing ones that 
    should be visited more often.
    \item \textbf{Confirm the daily plan}\\
    Confirm the daily plan at the end of the day or update it in case of deviations.
\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{User characteristics}
The application has been thought for the three different user categories that follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy makers} are government's employees that are in charge of analysing the general agricolture trends among all the districts in Telangana, then promote based state-wide policies to better the whole food system. Their main goal is not only to secure the current provision, but also to identify now the best practices that will lead to a flourishing food production in the future. By doing so, the plan is to grow more resiliant and profitable crops and prepare the lands to face future menaces, for instance the climate that is getting more hostile or the foreseen increment of the food demand. As a consequence, they want to be notified about the best performing farmers in order to contact them and get more insight from them about their procedures, with the aim to acquire best practises to be shared and applied on a larger scale. At the same time, they need to know who, on the other hand, is performing particularly badly, so that they can be given the help they need to better their results, since obtaining the foresaid goal requires the structure to run smoothly in all its parts. 
    Policy makers also need a feedback system that let them be aware of the true impact \textit{a posteriori} of the initiatives carried out by the agronomists in collaboration with the knowledge and practice of the best farmers.
    \item \textbf{Farmers} are interested in functionalities that will help with their day-to-day life at work, so they would like to receive in one place all the information about the weather to plan before hand the work day and useful data, like suggestions and news about the specific crop they cultivate, if some crop's illness is spreading in their area and how to treat it, which fertilizers boost the plant's production, etc. Moreover, they should insert data about their own production and ask for help to a regional agronomist through the app if it's needed. Being part of a larger community of people that share the same purpose (such as being more productive) brings more knowledge in general, so it's easier for the farmers to get in touch with their collegues that grow the same crops and might have faced the same challenges they do through the in-app forum. The feature allows them to enlarge their pool of acquaintances and brings them together online, even though they might be kilometers away from each other.
    \item \textbf{Agronomists} are the experts in the agricolture field, so the main function needed for them is the possibility of helping out the farmers that reach out to them. Each agronomist is in charge of a specific geographical area in Telangana, in order to be efficiently present on the territory in a fair and useful way according to the actual helping demand. In fact, they visit each farm spread among their area at least twice a year. That said, agronomists would like some functionalities that help them planning out their trips on the field in an simple yet flexible way. Furthermore, they would like to be notified of the farms' performace, especially the ones scoring poor results in order to plan their visits more often for those, depending on the problem their facing. Nonetheless, in order to make a complete and axhaustive report about the area productivity for the central government, they are also interested into acknowledging the top performing farms. %wheather forcast? go deeper in explaining daily plan funct?
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item D1: Agronomists actually stick to the scheduled daily plan
    \item D2: Agronomists correct their schedule at the end of the day if deviations occur
    \item D3: Each user registers according to their role and always feeds correct information to the app
    \item D4: The internet connection works properly
    \item D5: The sensors measuring humidity level of the soil work properly
    \item D6: Weather forecasts are accurate up to a 80\% for the short-term and up to 60\% on the long-term
    \item D7: Water irrigation system send the information accurately, with an error of at most 1\%
    \item D8: Agronomists always replay to farmers requests of help
    \item D9: Farmers periodically insert data about their crop status and resulting production
