\section{Introduction}
\emph{Data-dRiven PrEdictive FArMing}, also known as \emph{DREAM}, is a project presented by UNDP India and Healthsites initiative, promoted by Telangana's government.
The aim of the project is to enhance the farm system and the entire food supply chain with an IT supporting application. 
This arises from modern challenges like climate change and the foreseen population growth that have underlined the critical issues of the modern system making necessary a complete revision.


\subsection{Purpose} %goals of the project
\emph{DREAM} aims to support the work categories involved into the farming industry by providing them relevant and up-to-date data about farms activity's performance. 
The main stakeholders are: Telangana policy makers, farmers and agronomists.
The goal is to develop a data-driven application with the help of IT partners.
Telangana's state already collect important data concerning wheather forecast; these data are publicly available with a live rainfall map on the official government website.
Other data can be collected through humidity sensors deployed all over the territory and through the water irrigation system.

Agriculture has a main role in India's economy, more than half of the population depends on it and about a fifth is below the poverty line.
Furthermore, as a significant increment in population is expected by 2050 (\emph{UN}'s esteem), food demand is going to significantly increase.
Telangana needs an efficient application to increase the general productivity of the farm system.

The user base is expected to include a large part of Telangana's population, bringing together people with different knowledge backgrounds, such as people directly working in the agricolture field up to political figures.

\subsubsection{Goals}
\newcounter{goalCtr}
\underline{Shared goals}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Reach out to farmers in need of help} \\ Farmers that struggle with their cultivation wish to be helped and turn around their business in a positive way, since their income depend on that. At the same time, given the forseen food supply demand, policy makers and agronomists strive for reaching the maximum potential of every suppliers.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{Telangana's policy makers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Identification of well-performing  and under-performing farmers}\\
    Main goal of the policy makers is to identify farmers that are resilient to meteorological adverse events.
    %This can be done comparing the productivity ratio defined as the produced amount per product in adverse condition over the amount in standard conditions.
    These farmers will receive special incentives as a compensation for being asked to share their own best practices with the policy maker and agronomist that might apply them on a larger scale later.

    Identify farmers that are performing badly in order to seek the help for them to get back on track. In fact, they are the ones that need to be helped by the agronomists and by regulation promoted by policy makers promoting better practices.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize the results of steering initiatives}\\
    Visualize and evaluate the results produced by the steering initiatives from agronomists and good farmers in order to assess which are resulting useful and actually improving the food production system, so that those practices can be applied on a larger scale. 
    
    In order to check the general productivity and health of Telangana's lands, policy makers can base their evaluations by also monitoring the data sent by humidity sensors and the smart water irrigation systems installed across the territory.
\end{enumerate}
\underline{Farmers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize relevant data for the business}\\
    Visualize important data like weather forecast and personalized suggestion about specific crops or fertilizers.
    All data are based on location and type of production.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Keep track of the production}\\
    Insert data about their production to identify trends of their own doings, especially bad ones undermining their revenue. Register every type of problem they're experiencing for further inspection with the help of experts in the field.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Request for help/suggestion}\\
    Farmers can request help with a text message that will be sent directly to the agronomists responsible of the area to better their practice both in critical conditions and for improvement purposes. %Thanks to this, the farmers are not required to know directly the contact of one of the agronomists, because the system will provide the contacts of the area they need automatically.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Create and participate in discussions concerning the agricolture field}\\
    Create forums to discuss with the other farmers. This feature shall allow a farmer-user to choose the name of a new topic they wish to introduce in the forum and to join all already open discussions. The purpose of this is to ease the cultivation-related knowledge spreading from which every farmer would benefit.
\end{enumerate}

\underline{Agronomists}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Receive requests for help/suggestion all in one place}\\
    Here the agronomist can manage all the incoming request for help or suggestion and will have an higher chance of intervening promptly in critical situations before it's too late. In fact, having just one place in which all the requests that need attention are cumulated makes easier for them to not miss any, rather than losing them because of the different means they could come from and in a unstructured way.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Visualize area statistics}\\
    Keep track of the area general performance through a list of best-performing farmers and visualize data about whether forecast.
    %The list of best-performing farmers is based on the productivity over a selected period of time.
    \item \textbf{(\stepcounter{goalCtr}G\arabic{goalCtr}) Easy daily planning procedure}\\
    The daily plan consists in a list of farms to be visited during the day.
    Since, by regulations, every farm must be visited at least twice a year, with particular attention to the under-performing ones that should be visited more often, agronomists wish to be suggested of which are the farms that are due to be visited or the ones that have not been visited yet during the year.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Key Performance Indexes}
%mettere dopo i goals?
To assess if the application is well integrating within the context for which it has been developed and it is actually serving its purpose, it is important to lay out some \textit{key performance indexes} (KPI) in order to deem the application as successful. Monitoring KPIs after the application has been deployed gives the opportunity to check if the the system is having a positive impact and working towards goals or, in the worst case scenario, identifies in which aspects it is lacking, so that it can be reworked tackling its defects.
\begin{itemize}  
    \item \textbf{(K1) Yield per plant/acre}: production quantity over the field area in which the crop has been grown.
    \item \textbf{(K2) Water per output}: by comparing the liters of water used by the irrigation system and the overall production quantity, region by region, we create a dataset on which it's possibile to weigh the performance's increment.
    \item \textbf{(K3) Farm visits}: number of visited farms in a month per agronomist, since the daily plan function aims to provide a more organised way of planning the vists to the farms, if the number of visits increases then it means it's also easier to schedule the visit.
    \item \textbf{(K4) Farmers' production entries}: number of the production entries in a year.
    \item \textbf{(K5) Users' interactivity}: number of messages exchanged by farmers with agronomists in a year or messages posted in the forum.
\end{itemize}

The previous KPIs are thought as indexes to understand if the application is reaching the expected goals, especially:

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product perspective}
DREAM is a system that offers the functionalities described in the \textit{Product Functions (\ref{product_functions})} section.
It manages to use some external interfaces, for more details refers to the \textit{Software Interfaces (\ref{software_interfaces})} section.
In the following subsections we can see a list of the most common scenarios \textit{(\ref{scenarios})} and an high-level class diagram \textit{(\ref{class_diagram})} that shows the basic structure of the system.
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\label{scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}

    \item Aanya has just passed her test to become a policy maker and wants to consult the app.
    To do so she decides to download and install DREAM in order to visualize the data concerning her job.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She opens the app and click on the "Sign Up" button
        \item She inserts all her data in order to fill every mandatory field and presses the "Confirm" button
        \item The system verifies that the e-mail isn't already present in the database. Since there isn't an entry for her e-mail yet, it allows the registration and shows a confirmation message to Aanya's mailbox
        \item She checks her mailbox in order to verify that the procedure ended successfully
    \end{itemize}

    \item Apu is an expert policy maker, he wants to know what are the latest data regarding soil humidity and water irrigation.
    Without DREAM app, Apu should have gone through raw data found on Telangana's government website, logging in the portal, and manually created graphs to easily analyse the data. Now, with DREAM:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He takes his phone and logs in DREAM app 
        \item He presses the "Visualize Data" button
        \item The system retrieves data from a database and shows him the soil moisture and the consumed liters of water by the irrigation system thorughtout graphs that computes the average quantities across the Country in a span of one year
        \item He wishes to have more detailed information about the soil humidity and the water irrigation in Adilabad district since he read an alarming report about that region.
        He choses it from the menu and sets the time span at two weeks
        \item The system gives him new graphs reporting only data about soil humidity and water used for irrigation retrieved by Adilabad's sensors in the last two weeks
        \item He analyzes them and decides that he will talk about it later with a colleague, then he returns to the home page
    \end{itemize} 

    \item Pajeet is one of the main policy makers in the state of Telangana.
    He wants to distribute special incentives to the best farmers and to do this he decides
    to open the app and visualize the data. Before the introduction of DREAM, Pajeet didn't have a way of identify well-performing farmers, instead now:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He opens the app on his device. Since he's already registered, he logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for a policy maker user
        \item He visualizes the ranking of the well-performing farmers
        \item He clicks on the name of a farmer
        \item Now the system shows the profile of the selected farmer
        \item Here the policy maker can find useful contact information such as phone number (if it has been given by the farmer) and email
        \item He takes note of the desirable contact information and closes the app
    \end{itemize}

    \item Sahil is a farmer that would like to share some best-practices about a particular product that he has cultivated last year. Before using DREAM, Sahil could have achieved this by word of mouth, restricted to only his closer friends, while now he can share them with all the app's users.
    He decides to open a new discussion on the forum.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He opens the app on his device. Since he's already registered, he logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for a farmer user
        \item He clicks on the "Forum" button and access the forum section
        \item Now he clicks on the "Create new topic" button where he can select the name of the discussion
        \item He posts a new message in the discussion
        \item Finally some time later he checks if someone has joined his topic and replied to him
    \end{itemize}

    \item Damayanti is a farmer that would like to improve the productivity of his farm.
    To do so he decides to consult the section regarding the suggestions on specific crops to plant or specific fertilizers to use.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He opens the app on his device, if he is already registered he logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for a farmer user
        \item He clicks on the "News" button and access the news section
        \item Here he visualizes suggestions based on his type of production and on his location
        \item If he is not satisfied, then he clicks on the "Request for help" button to send a message
        \item Here the app suggests him the agronomist responsible of the area and opens a text section where he can type his requests for suggestions
        \item Otherwise, he takes note from the article he read
        \item He closes the app
    \end{itemize}

    \item Chakrika is a young farmer and decided to insert the data regarding last week production.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She takes her computer and logs in DREAM
        \item The system shows her the farmers home page
        \item She presses the "Insert production data" button
        \item She inserts the total quantity of rice harvested last week 
        \item She checks the inserted data and finally press the "Confirm" button 
        \item The system sends her back to the home page
    \end{itemize}

    \item Shaleena is an agronomist responsible of Mahbubnagar, one of the biggest region in Telangana. She wants to compose the daily plan to decides which farms to visit today.
    In order to do so, Shaleena had to go through all the farms' district register and find out which she had already visited that year by comparing her previous reports, then choose some that have not been visited yet and scribble their addresses in her notes.
    Now, with DREAM app, it's easier since all she has to do is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She opens the app on his device, if she is already registered she logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for an agronomist user
        \item She clicks on the "Daily plan" button and access the new section
        \item She adds the farms she wants to visit to the daily plan by choosing them from the list of available ones
        \item Now the system shows the addresses and the date of the last visit of the selected farms
        \item She takes note of the addresses and close the app
    \end{itemize}
    \item Chaitanya is an agronomist that after a hard day of work wants to update the daily plan on the app.
    At the end of the day she realizes that she has visited three farms instead of the two indicated in the daily plan.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She opens the app on his device, if she is already registered she logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for an agronomist user
        \item She clicks on the "Daily plan" button and access the new section
        \item Here she can visualize the daily plan
        \item She can click on the "Add" or on the "Remove" button
        \item In case of "Add" the system would redirect her to the list of available ones, in case of "Remove" she can delete a farm 
        from the list simply by clicking on the cross at the right
        \item She clicks on the "Confirm" button to validate the daily plan
        \item The system returns to the homepage
        \item Finally she closes the app
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Pradeep is an agronomist who wants to take care about help requests before going to work.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item He opens the app on his device, if he is already registered he logs in
        \item The system shows the homepage for an agronomist user
        \item He clicks on the "Mail box" button and access the new section
        \item Here he visualizes a list of help requests
        \item By clicking on a help request he can visualize the request and answer it
        \item He does this for every help request until they are finished
        \item Finally he closes the app and begins his working day
    \end{itemize} 

    \item Sonya is an agronomist that want to check who are the best farmers of her responsibility area.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item She take her IT device and log in the system 
        \item She can already see who are the top farmers of the area
        \item She press the widget and look deeply the ranking
        \item She press the "Home" button to return to home page
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Class diagram}
\label{class_diagram}
A UML class diagram describes the main entities in the system.
Three types of actors can access the system: farmers, policy makers and agronomists.
During the sign-up, they all create a user account with basic information such as username, password and e-mail.
At this point, users are requested to choose what type of account to create. It is crucial that phisycal users register themselves accordingly to their job to ensure that the system works properly. Furthermore, this choice affects the next steps in the registration phase; for example, to complete the registration, farmers need to specify the position of their farm and what type of crop they grow, whereas agronomists must declare their area of responsibility.

The system provides several functionalities tailored for the type of user, one of these is the forum for the farmers. When the farmers select the forum section, they are presented with the topics that are already active. For each topic, the discussion that has evolved through time can be seen: it's composed by the original post and its replies from other users. From here, the user can join an already ongoing discussion or create a new one generating a new topic and post the first message for it.

Another functionality is the \textit{daily plan} feature for the agronomists.
A daily plan is a list of farms that an agronomist has decided to visit on a particular day of the year, it has a date and a status flag that indicates whether the plan has already been confirmed or not\footnotemark. %The schedule can be planned from the day before the actual visit and be confirmed until 23:59 of the visiting day. If the agronomist fills the plan and doesn't confirm it before the time limit expires, then the system will automatically assumes that the schedule has been followed and will archive it at the end of the day. 
For the planner, agronomists have access to the list of farmers currently in their area of responsibility and registered to the app.
\footnotetext{More technical details can be found in the DD document.}

Finally, there are various types of data that can be visualized and analyzed by the users
depending on the type of their account.
There are four types of data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Soil humidity sensors data}\\
    Acquired by the sensors distributed all over the territory, they report values that represent the soil moisture level of the land they cover.
    \item \textbf{Weather forecast data}\\
    Meteorological short-term and long-term forecast acquired by Telangana's government and displayed on their official website. They are comprehensive of temperature, rainfall probability and quantity, direction and strength of the wind and air humidity.
    \item \textbf{Water irrigation data}\\
    Acquired by the water irrigation system installed in the farms, the only significant value is the amount of water used by the system during the day.
    \item \textbf{Production data}\\
    Provided by the farmers, this type of data is displayed as a table that maps the type of cultivated product to the sown amount and the respective harvested quantity.
    \item \textbf{Report}\\
    Reports are written by Agronomists whenever they lead new initiatives aiming to better the results of cultivation in their area. The reports include a detailed explanation of the content of the initiative and the feedback they've been collecting since their attuation.

\subsubsection{Sign-up and shared functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sign-up:} let the user sign-up thorugh an email and a password, creating a profile tailored for the user's job. Specify the area in which they live and what type of cultivation they manage\footnotemark. The adding of a farmland is done by inserting its coordinates (raw coordinates or by selecting a spot on the map) into the app, since it's difficult to find a location through an address in rural areas.

\subsubsection{Policy makers functions}
\begin{itemize}                                 
    \item \textbf{Visualize relevant data and initiatives:} let the policy makers know a variety of data like the performances of the farmers by grouping them in a rank to know who are the farmers that are performing well and who are the worst one mainly based upon the production data provided by them\footnotemark.
    Policy makers can also visualize the steering iniziatives presented by the agronomists' reports that are collected into a specific subsection of their application.
\end{itemize}
\footnotetext{The actual function computing the score is defined in the DD document.}
\subsubsection{Farmers functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Getting information about the agricolture field:} allow farmers to visualize news relevant to their business interests such as: wheather forecast for the day or for the next few days, articles posted on major online farming magazines that are related to their own crop type or area and specific fertilizers for their needs.
    \item \textbf{Agronomists Interactions:} allow farmers to send messages to the agronomist.
    \item \textbf{Building a community on the forum:} allow farmers to create a new topic or join in a discussion in the dedicated forum.
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\subsubsection{Agronomists functions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{District statistics:} visualize district related data like wheather forecast or the rank of the farmers in that region.
    \item \textbf{Manage farmers requests:} agronomists reply to farmers' requests for help or suggestion.
    \item \textbf{Manage daily plan:} allow the agronomist to make their daily plan by registring the scheduled visits to the farmers. At the end of the day an agronomist must confirm if they were able to complete the plan or specify the deviations occurred during the day. Updating the daily plan because of a deviation means either adding a farm that has been visited during that day that was not originally in the plan, or removing one from the schedule if the agronomist has not been able to pay a visit that same day.

\subsection{User characteristics}
The application has been thought for the three different user categories that follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy makers} are government's employees that are in charge of analysing the general agricolture trends among all the districts in Telangana, then promote based state-wide policies to better the whole food system. Their main goal is not only to secure the current provision, but also to identify now the best practices that will lead to a flourishing food production in the future. By doing so, the plan is to grow more resilient and profitable crops and prepare the lands to face future menaces, for instance the climate that is getting more hostile or the foreseen increment of the food demand. As a consequence, they want to be notified about the best performing farmers in order to contact them and get more insight from them about their procedures, with the aim to acquire best practises to be shared and applied on a larger scale. At the same time, they need to know who, on the other hand, is performing particularly badly, so that they can be given the help they need to better their results, since obtaining the foresaid goal requires the structure to run smoothly in all its parts. 
    Policy makers also need a feedback system that let them be aware of the true impact \textit{a posteriori} of the initiatives carried out by the agronomists in collaboration with the knowledge and practice of the best farmers.
    \item \textbf{Farmers} are interested in functionalities that will help with their day-to-day life at work, so they would like to receive in one place all the information about the weather to plan before hand the work day and useful data, like suggestions and news about the specific crop they cultivate, if some crop's illness is spreading in their area and how to treat it, which fertilizers boost the plant's production, etc. Moreover, they should insert data about their own production and ask for help to a regional agronomist through the app if it's needed. Being part of a larger community of people that share the same purpose (such as being more productive) brings more knowledge in general, so it's easier for the farmers to get in touch with their collegues that grow the same crops and might have faced the same challenges they do through the in-app forum. The feature allows them to enlarge their pool of acquaintances and brings them together online, even though they might be kilometers away from each other.
    \item \textbf{Agronomists} are the experts in the agriculture field, so the main function needed for them is the possibility of helping out the farmers that reach out to them. Each agronomist is in charge of a specific geographical area in Telangana, in order to be efficiently present on the territory in a fair and useful way according to the actual helping demand. In fact, they visit each farm spread among their area at least twice a year. That said, agronomists would like some functionalities that help them planning out their trips on the field in an simple yet flexible way. Furthermore, they would like to be notified of the farms' performace, especially the ones scoring poor results in order to plan their visits more often for those, depending on the problem their facing. Nonetheless, in order to make a complete and exhaustive report about the area productivity for the central government, they are also interested into acknowledging the top performing farms. %wheather forecast? go deeper in explaining daily plan funct?

\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}
\newcounter{assumptionCtr}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists correct their schedule at the end of the day if deviations occur
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Each user registers only once, according to their job, and always feeds correct information to the app
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: The internet connection works properly when the application is being used\footnotemark
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: The sensors measuring humidity level of the soil work properly, with at most an error of 1\%
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Weather forecasts are accurate up to a 80\% for the short-term and up to 60\% on the long-term
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Water irrigation system send the information accurately, with an error of at most 1\%
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists always reply to farmers requests of help
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Farmers periodically insert data about their crop status and resulting production
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Data inserted by the Farmers sticks to the reality of the produced quantity.
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Agronomists periodically report their initiatives to the central government.
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Users own an IT device to connect to the application
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Devices external to the system (e.g. humidity sensors, water irrigation systems, weather stations) are active and working properly for 99.9\% of the year
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Each Telangana's district has one and only one Agronomist\footnotemark[\value{footnote}]
    \item \stepcounter{assumptionCtr}D\arabic{assumptionCtr}: Sensor data, irrigation system data, weather forecast reports and news source can be accessed by the app through API
\end{itemize}
\footnotetext{This constraint is purposely stronger than what it could be in order to simplify a future implementation of the prototype (e.g. it won't allow local storaging of data while the device is not connected to internet, just one agronomist per district, etc.). It could be relaxed in a further release of the application.}

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
The system should interface with users through devices which must be connected to the Internet.
Everyone that needs to use this service would connect to it through a web broswer from its existing domain (e.g. \textit{dream.com}).
It has to be easy to interact with as it is going to be used from different kinds of people, may be without an extensive technological background.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
\label{hardware_interfaces}
The system "as it is" does not provide specific hardware equipment in order to access to web site. To use all functionalities it's required to have an IT device connected to the internet; potentially a user can decide to use GPS to insert his/her own location and only proper devices equipped with GPS can do this. 

Soil data and water irrigation data, obtained from sensors, are collected by other organizations (not by DREAM) that manage to let external services (like DREAM app) access them through their API. So these sensors are required by DREAM app but they're not handled by it.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\label{software_interfaces}
In order to use the system, a web broswer is required to run the application.

Main application aside, whose functionalities are described in this document, the system will also take advantage of some interfaces in order to accomplish its requirements.

Firstly, an external API is necessary to visualize on maps a farm's position or to let farmers locate their farm in registration phase.

Then, another API service will be the one of the DBMS system which will be adopted in order to query the internal database.

As already mentioned in section \ref{hardware_interfaces}, an API will be used to retrieve the data regarding the humidity sensors, the water irrigation systems, as well as weather forecast reports and news about agricolture, which all come from external data sources but are needed by DREAM system.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
Internet connection is essential in order to access every information that the system will display. Without connection, the app won't work.
Users that wish to experience the app's full functionalities should have a device equipped with GPS, in order to guarantee a certain level of precision in the localization phase, but this is not mandatory.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The majority of the user base will be represented by the farmers that cover the 58\% \cite{specification} of the entire population of Telengana, while the number of policy-maker and agronomist users is fairly irrelevant.
According to Unique Identification Aadhar India, Telangana population in 2021 is estimated to be 39.9 million\cite{population}.
This means that the system is expected to be widely adopted with the registration of millions of users just in the first year.
Also the average workload of the system is expected to be high, the goal is to guarantee the simultaneous connection of at least 2 millions of individuals.
A mid-term goal could be to improve the scalability of the system in order to guarantee an efficient service to all users.
Finally the system should have a good response time, less than 0.5 seconds is reasonable.
\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
DREAM's user data must be treated respecting the law according to the PDPA\cite{pdpa}.
The system must require the user the permission to activate the GPS in order to get the position.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The software is designed to enhance the portability, in fact it is enough to have a device with a stable internet connection. But this might be a challenge given the context in which the system has to integrate in, so it represents also the system's limitation.
In order to fully use the application, it is required to have a device equipped with GPS.
%\subsubsection{Any other constraint}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
\subsubsection{Reliability}
To ensure data consistency the system must have a fully backup infrastructure, this allows to recover from general failures in the main system.
The five components shown in the \textit{Figure(\ref{fig: availability})} operate in parallel, this guarantees high reliability and the correct functioning of the overall system in the case of a single component failure.
Finally all the components of the system must be characterized by the highest MTTF and by the lowest MTTR possible.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The system should be up almost 24/7 in order to allow users to use the application's services at any time.
The peak of usage is expected to be during the working hours, so it means that it is better to do all the maintainance activities during the night hours.

        \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Availability} & \textbf{Downtime}\\
        \hline
        Main System & 99.999\% (5-nines) & 5 minutes/year\\
        Google Maps API & 99.999\% (5-nines) & 5 minutes/year\\
        Humidity Sensors & 99\% (2-nines) & 3.65 days/year\\
        Water Irrigation System & 99.9\% (3-nines) & 8.76 hours/year\\
        Weather Forecast & 99.9\% (3-nines) & 8.76 hours/year\\
        News & 99.999\% (5-nines) & 5 minutes/year\\

        Entire System & 99.998\% & 10 minutes/year
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Security}
All the data stored by the system must be encrypted with a standard algorithm like the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
The communication passes through a secure channel powered by the HTTPS and SSL protocol.
All data should be stored in compliance with PDPA's regulation.
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
The maintainability is guaranteed by high standard of code, the use of design patterns will enhance this point and guarantee high reusability.
The code must be extensively tested.
The system must be extendible in order to support future updates.
User's application will be regularly updated.
\subsubsection{Portability}
The system is designed to work on different operating systems like Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS and Android since it depends on a web browser.
All main browsers are going to be supported: Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge.

\section{Formal Analysis using Alloy}
\subsection{Formal Analysis Purpose}
The following analysis aims to formally prove the correctness of the system model by exploiting Alloy verification tool. To achieve so, we test the model by checking if some of the previous defined goals are met. 

Specifically, we stress:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{(G3) Visualize the result of steering initiatives}: it is modelled as an assertion that checks the ability of the system to retrieve all the reports written by the agronomists and present them to each policy maker.
    \item \textbf{(G4) Visualize relevant data for the farmer business}: the goal is checked by asserting that if and only if there's a news concerning some crop type \textit{x} or a certain area \textit{y}, then the system will present it to all the farmers growing crop type \textit{x} or working in area \textit{y}.
    \item \textbf{(G5) Keep track of the production}: thanks to the predicate, we can formally illustrate the scenario in which a farmer two entries of production are succesfully registered in his/her history production in app (refer to fig. \ref{fig: productionInsertion}).
    \item \textbf{(G6) Request for help/suggestions}: the aim here is to make sure that every farmer that files an help request, there will always be an agronomist (in particular, the one related to the same district where the farm is) that will reply. We show this through an assertion and a predicate that illustarte an instance of this messages' exchange (see fig. \ref{fig: helpRequestAlloy}). Furthermore, we display that some news that are deemed as interesting for a farmer, are actually presented to him/her (refer to fig. \ref{fig: interestingNews}).
    \item \textbf{(G7) Create and participate in discussions concerning the agricolture field}: through two assertions, we make sure that every farmer can create a new topic in the Forum as long as he/she belong to the system and can also join discussions already started by anyone else. Moreover, we make sure thanks to another assertion that each farmer posting something in a dicussion gets automatically linked to the same forum topic. Finally, we show an example of the dynamics that could happen in a forum topic, as shown in fig. \ref{fig: forumDynamics}.
    \item \textbf{(G8) Receive requests of help all in one place}: we check that all the help requests filed by farmers end up in exactly one agronomist's inbox, that is the agronomist whose area of competence matches with the region to which the farmer belongs.
    \item \textbf{(G10) Easy daily planning procedure}: we show an instance of an agronomist's daily plan and we make sure that every farm planned to visit is in the same region of competence of the agronomist.
\end{itemize}

Plus, we runned some empty predicates \texttt{show} to generate some more general instances of the app system.
